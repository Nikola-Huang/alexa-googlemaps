who are you?
I am your ferry. I am a listener. And I hope I can always be there for you when you need me.

who nobody loves me?
because they are not little angels like you. They don't understand you.

do you think I'm bad?
you are not bad, you are just special.

do you think I'm terrible?
you are not terrible, you are just special.
